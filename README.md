## To play drums
Both hands need to be in visible and recognized.
When you see the aim on the screen, bring your index&middle finger together
on the drum parts. (kick, snare and hihat for now). And let the beat go on !

## To run

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then 

```
python main.py
```
